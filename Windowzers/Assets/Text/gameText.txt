In a not so distant Future an evil Corporation "Windoze" has attempted to take over the planet and kill every other operating system.
The unlikely Hero is a random_Nerd who has embraced the power of linux onto himself with the hope to make it through this dystopian world.
Unfortunately the very People who he has sworn to save have had there souls sucked out by the evil corporation and have become windozers.
In a last ditch attempt to save these people he will shoot linux penguins freeing the soul of the windozers. 
You must do your best to make it through this world within the time limit otherwise you yourself will become a windozer.
Collect windoze symbols to gain time onto your life and remember to make it to the next level you must find a key hidden somewhere on each level.




So the random_Nerd proved to himself and everyone that is left on the planet that with the power of linux 
even the mighty Windozers can be defeated. He stood a shinning becon of hope.
